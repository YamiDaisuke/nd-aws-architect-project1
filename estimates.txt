With this implementation a single AZ outage should have an minimum RTO of approximately 60 seconds
(accordingly to AWS documentation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html),
however with a single Region outage it will take a minimum of approximately 5 minutes to promote the
read replica.

In case of RPO also we can face up to 60 seconds during AZ outage promotion process and 5 minutes
during a region outage promotion process. This values however can be reduced if applications connected
to database are shut down as soon as we detect AZ or region outages.
